# rust-snake

One of my favorite ways to learn a new programming language, is by implementing simple retro games and my Rust journey has been no different. As the name implies, `rust-snake` is a Rust implementation of the classic Snake game, with some extra bells and whistles. The overall code layout is heavily inspired by this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT_7M7L7vo) video, although I do feel I improved the code a fair bit.
